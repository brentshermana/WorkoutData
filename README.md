# WorkoutData
lightweight, terminal-based application for storing data for almost any form of exercise written in Java



The gist of the program:
there are two options, to add and save new data, or view previously added data.
Data is loaded to and saved from program-created files. The user should NOT alter these files directly.

ExerciseNames.txt and PUSH UPS.txt are provided for as example files. If the user doesn't want to use
'push ups' as an exercise, then PUSH UPS.txt and the line reading 'PUSH UPS within ExerciseNames.txt
should both be removed'. Removing ExerciseNames.txt, however, will render the program useless.

To avoid unwanted alteration or loss of files, it is suggested that ythe user import all files from
this repository and store them within a single folder, separate from all other content
